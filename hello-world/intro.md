<h1>SSH key-based authentication</h1>

<h2>Welcome to the SSH key-based authentication for Ubuntu scenario!</h2>

SSH is a secure, encrypted protocol for managing remote devices such as Linux and BSD servers and network devices like those made by Cisco and Juniper.

In a default installation on Linux, it uses username and password for authentication.

This is a very insecure way to manage remote authentication and a better option is available to us with just a few steps.

Key-based authentication is much more secure in that the key generated is nearly impossible to guess, and without it, once you're set up, an attacker won't be able to log in.

If you've never configured key-based authentication for SSH it can be a little confusing.

We'll walk through the process, step-by-step, together here.
